# 🧬 Cancer Type Classification Using Gene Expression Data

This project presents a complete machine learning pipeline for predicting cancer types using RNA-seq gene expression profiles. It includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature selection, model training, validation, and test evaluation — all implemented in Python using scikit-learn and XGBoost.

---

## 📚 Overview

- 🔬 **Dataset**: RNA-seq gene expression data, with cancer types grouped into biologically relevant categories.
- 🧪 **Task**: Multiclass classification to predict cancer group from gene expression profiles.
- 🧠 **ML Models**: Logistic Regression, SVM, Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boosting.

## 📊 Features

### 🧬 Feature Selection
- Top 75 genes selected from each of 3 methods:
  - ANOVA F-score
  - Mutual Information
  - Random Forest importance
- Final features = **intersection** of top 75 from all three methods

### 🤖 Model Training & Evaluation
- Data split into **train (60%) / validation (20%) / test (20%)**
- Six classifiers trained and evaluated using:
  - Precision, Recall, F1-score
  - Macro-averaged ROC-AUC
- Best model selected by **validation F1-score**
- Final performance reported on the **independent test set**

### 📈 Visual Outputs
- PCA plots
- Heatmaps (correlation & sample-gene)
- ROC curves (macro-average)
- Confusion matrices
